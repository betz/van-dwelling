## Avoid power transformators

It is useless to invert your 12V DC power to 230V AC power with an inverter if all you do is plug in a AC/DC converter to go back to 12V. Best is to use as much tools straight from your 12V DC battery.

Some examples.

### Refrigerator

Use a combi absorption fridge that runs on 12V DC, Gas, or 230V AC for when attached to the grid.
